The board controls the temperature of the room reading a tmp102 and switching a fan.
A second tmp102 controls the temperature of the heating part to avoid turning on the fan if no heat is available.
The display normally shows the room temperature.
The setpoint value is shown when pushing the button.
To avoid unwanted setpoint changing, the modification of the setpoint is subjected to password control.
The password is inserted as a number that has to be dialed using the encoder knob.
The password is fixed in code (33); once dialed the setpoint is shown and can be modified turning the encoder.
Under password 22 the temperature of the heater is shown
Under password 44 the 485 board ID is shown and made editable
A minimal communication protocol is made available to allow remote monitoring and control by a remote pc, actually a Raspberry pi.
